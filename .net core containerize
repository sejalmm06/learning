______________.net core used three languages__________________________________

    C# is often the preferred choice for most developers due to its modern features and versatility, but each language has its advantages:
        Choose C# if you want a general-purpose, object-oriented language with a large community and a wide range of applications (web, mobile, desktop, gaming).
        Choose F# if you're interested in functional programming or working with tasks like data science, AI, or complex mathematical computations.
        Choose VB.NET if you're working with legacy systems, need rapid application development with an easy-to-understand syntax, or are transitioning from older VB6 applications.
